	(>10000), (5000, 10000], (1000, 5000], (100, 1000] and (<100).
	They argue that the decline in contributions by the Wikipedia
	elite (>10000 edits) is due to a rise in the contributions of the bourgeoisie (<100 edit users).
	One surprising thing they mention is that bots don't account for the
	reduction in the number of edits being done by the elite users.
	From our analysis, AntiVandalBot ranks highest in many metrics.
	
	Also, in 3, the authors state that measured in terms of number
	of edits or in terms of edit differences, they get similar results.
	All pointing to their title ``A reduction in elite participation
	accompanied by an increase in participation of the bourgeoisie''.

	They describe an ``acceptance factor'' which represents the
