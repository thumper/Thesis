    Authors automatically create a corpus by searching for rollbacks,

    confidence that the quality judgement is correct.
    They evaluate with a precision-recall curve.

    Authors show that metadata is sufficient to predict edit quality.
    But they are exploiting the spatio-temporal properties of the metadata,
    which is another way of saying that they are building a reputation
    system based on concepts (IP block, Country) which are not specific
    to a single user.  That is, they are exploiting the fact that users
    with a similar background tend to behave similarly (homophily w/ cite).

    Points:
      * West cites Hao's spatio-temporal ideas (which seem to just be a
	specific instance of homophily that West next mentions).
	This is interesting because it can be extended to looking at how
	users interact with each other as well.
    TODO: Do users who interact with each other tend to have user reputations
        that are related or correlated?  (This seems related to Rut Jesus'
	work presented at Wikimania 2009, on graphing users that interact
	with each other.)  There is also a question of what does it mean
	to interact.  Is editing the same article enough?  The ten authors
	that came before you?  Or should you edit words near each other (e.g.,

    Rather than building a user reputation system, the authors build
    a system to predict the quality of an edit --- which is essentially
    something like a vandalism detection tool.
    They use precision-recall curves to show the performance of their system,
    and show that there system performs poorly unless they also consider
    features about the content of the edit.  Even then the best performance
    they get seems to be around 70\% PR-AUC.

    Their evaluation tests two things:
    1) can they predict which edits will be reverted right away
    2) can they predict high versus low quality;which seems to defined
	by a cutoff of their edit longevity value... the wording here
	is very poor, because they say that they predict the expected
	edit longevity.

    Points:
      * by using metadata about the edit, they essentially give anonymous
	users a non-zero reputation.  This is an interesting idea.
      * they define a notion of edit quality or edit longevity.
      * their formula for edit longevity is a little tricky.
        Also, it's a weird kind of sum; if all the text always survives,
        then they end up summing the delta times.  (Presumably, $t_i$ is
	the time in epoch seconds, since i is already an index.)
	Since they are summing arbitrary seconds (and in the worst case,
	something like 1+2+3+4+\ldots), this doesn't seem like a prediction
	of when the words will be deleted, only a relative kind of value.
      * In abstract, they make the point that detection based on user
        alone isn't enough.
    TODO: they cite (Stvilia, 2008) as defining quality in terms of the community
	  that is doing the interpretation.
    TODO: In there related work (Anthony, 2007), they say ``as the number of
    edits contributed increases, quality decreases for unregistered users,
    whereas it increases for registered users.''
    TODO: Investigate idea of giving users a non-zero reputation.
