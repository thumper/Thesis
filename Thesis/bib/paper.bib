	a rocketship.  You want to estimate the number of bugs left
	in the system, so you keep testing it.
	Sometimes it succeeds, and your confidence increases.
	Sometimes it fails and your confidence decreases, but
	the engineers also try to fix the problem (and possibly
	introduce new problems), so how do you model this?
