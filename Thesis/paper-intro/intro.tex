\section{Introduction}

The problem with modern research trends (Google Pagerank, Netflix
prize, etc) is that we're pursuing human ideas of ``good''.
There is no gold standard, no way to prove correctness except
by example and rhetoric.
This research has the same problem, though we've tried to address
that by having human evaluations and other measures.
