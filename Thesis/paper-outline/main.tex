    \section{Related Work}
        Work of Deborah McGuinness.  Why didn't this work take off?
        (because it didn't have a tool)
    \section{Conclusion}
        Our work didn't take off either, even with a tool.
        Reputation is neat, but not a core need.

\chapter{Revision Selection}
    Work of Martin Walker.
    Original idea to pick revision with highest average reputation.
    Idea to propagate reputation backwards, to give better reputation
    to old revisions.
    New idea is to pick revisions least likely to have vandalism.

    \section{Features}
        Is it possible to visualize the amount of information
        contained in each feature?
        Has previous work always been a blend of metadata, NLP,
        and reputation?
    \section{Edits}
        Which edits did we guess correctly, where others didn't?
        Why did we guess correctly?  Was it because they were edits
        by old users?
