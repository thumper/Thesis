    \section{Features}
        Is it possible to visualize the amount of information
        contained in each feature?
        Has previous work always been a blend of metadata, NLP,
        and reputation?
    \section{Edits}
        Which edits did we guess correctly, where others didn't?
        Why did we guess correctly?  Was it because they were edits
        by old users?
