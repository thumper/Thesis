Thanks to Luca, who never gave up when I needed him and saw
me through the ups and downs of the years.

Jessica and Adam, Kenn and Gloria, and Deb and Ron
saw me through the darkest hours --- I am indebted to you
for your caring when mine failed me.
And there are so many friends and family, new and old,
that were characters in this adventure and gave me their
support and encouragement and compassion.
You all have my deepest thanks.

%I had no idea there was so much dancing involved in grad school.
