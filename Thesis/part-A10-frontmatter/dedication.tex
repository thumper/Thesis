To Pokey and Lala,
who both suffered that this work might be.\\
Their courage and love has been my greatest lesson.

Thanks to Luca, who never gave up when I needed him.
Ian, Vishwa, Krishnendu, and Marco were invaluable in
helping through the crunches.

Jessica and Adam, Kenn and Gloria, and Deb and Ron
saw me through the darkest hours --- I am indebted to you
for your caring when mine failed me.
And there are so many friends and family, new and old,
that were characters in this adventure and gave me their
support and encouragement and compassion.
I am the luckiest one.

I had no idea there was so much dancing involved in grad school.
