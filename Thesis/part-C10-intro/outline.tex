\section{Outline}

This work is divided into two halves.
Part~\ref{part:foundations} covers the basic concepts we developed
before a reputation system could be constructed.
Part~\ref{part:applications} covers applications that can
be built atop the basic concepts to create useful tools for
a collaborative community.

We start Part~\ref{part:foundations}
by defining terminology and notation in Chapter~\ref{ch:defs}.

We then introduce the author attribution problem in Chapter~\ref{ch:diff}.
To accord credit to authors for the work they do,
it is first necessary to identify their contribution properly.
We extend a traditional \intro{greedy text difference} algorithm to
account for the existance of multiple authors and the possibility
of restoring text from older revisions.

Chapter~\ref{ch:editquality} then looks at measuring the size of
an author contribution.
The well-known answer is to use edit distance~\cite{Levenshtein1966},
but we discover that the traditional formulation must be adjusted
to take into account the rearranging of text that some editors contribute.
We refine the definition to build on the result computed by the
algorithm in Chapter~\ref{ch:diff}, and account for the rearranging
and substitution of text.
Finally, we conclude the foundational elements by developing a measure
of edit quality in Chapter~\ref{ch:editquality}.
We construct this measure to estimate the approval or disapproval of
later authors on the same article.
By aggregating the judgement of multiple later authors, we arrive at
a value that represents the community's assessment of an edit.
