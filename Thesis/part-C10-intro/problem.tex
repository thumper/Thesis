\section{The Problem}

The Wikipedia's continued success depends on ill-intentioned users
not being able to overwhelm the well-intentioned users.
Communities are complicated systems, with people constantly joining and
leaving membership.
We can suppose that people continue to
join the Wikipedia community because most pages are
substantially useful and users feel that their contributions
\textit{add} to the resource,
giving them a sense of satisfaction~\cite{Benkler2002}.
If the amount of vandalism occurring were to increase so that
most users were only \textit{repairing} the Wikipedia, there
would be much less satisfaction and eventually people would
abandon the project.

The key problem this community faces is identifying vandalism
quickly to prevent the appearance (to casual users)
 of needing maintenance.
The RC Patrol acts as a guardian, and astonishingly, reverts and
rollbacks happen in under seven minutes.
\mynote{Calculate this value.  7min?}
Still, it is relatively easy to sneak vandalism by the
RC Patrol \mynote{There is a paper that discusses this?},
for example, on busy articles or articles which aren't mainstream.

  spelling of the Danish Prime Minister's last name, from Fogh, to Fjogh.
  The casual user who does not speak Danish, and happens to check
  the version history, has little indication on which might be correct.
  In fact, this is a case of vandalism
  (in Danish, a \textit{fjog} is a \textit{fool})
  that is quite subtle and wouldn't even be noticed by most users.}

Vandalism can be very hard to identify for inexperienced users.
Consider the example of Figure~\ref{fig-denmark},
which is an excerpt from the ``Politics of Denmark''
entry in the English Wikipedia: an anonymous user substitutes
``Fjogh'' for ``Fogh'' in the Prime Minister's last name.
This is a particularly subtle kind of vandalism,
because it requires knowledge of Danish
(\textit{fjog} translates to \textit{fool} or \textit{goofy})
to recognize this change as anything more than a spelling correction.
A sophisticated reader might recognize the broken link
as a hint on the true spelling, or even try to use Google
to research the name (both spellings return results, however).
The level of effort to recognize the error and
verify this relatively small detail is quite high.

Beyond vandalism, another issue which affects the perceived
quality of the Wikipedia are well-intentioned users to contribute
very low quality material.
For instance, material written from a
neutral point of view\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view}}
promotes the Wikipedia as an impartial resource that welcomes contributions
from all parties.
When a contribution does not adhere to this standard, the bias
detracts from the credibility of the article and can discourage
other users from participating in the community.

Historically, there are three inter-related approaches to
creating a repository of knowledge.
The most familiar method is \intro{formal publication} by an organization
which stakes their reputation on the material;
the Encyclop{\ae}dia Britannica is one famous example.
To achieve their high quality, articles in the
Encyclop{\ae}dia Britannica are written by experts
and then reviewed by peers and an editorial staff.
\intro{Peer review} is a second approach to the creation of
knowledge; this method is used extensively in science,
but we distinguish it from ``formal publication'' because
only the actual authors stand behind the veracity of the
material being reported.
\intro{Reputation} is a third approach attaching value
to knowledge; people naturally ascribe reputations to other
individuals, and will accept knowledge without verification from
sources that they feel have a high enough reputation.

The overarching question for the Wikipedia is
\textit{how do we maintain the good quality of articles?}
The historical approaches have all translated to online
knowledge repositories (\eg Google Knol\footnote{\url{http://knol.google.com}}
and Encyclop{\ae}dia Britannica
are based on formal publication,
Nupedia\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nupedia} \mynote{Maybe
this should really be a citation since it's not a link to
Nupedia.}}
was based on peer-review,
and Stack Exchange\footnote{\url{http://stackexchange.com}}
implements an explicit reputation system).
The best solution would be based on Artificial Intelligence to
evaluate the veracity of the material being submitted.
We propose that an automated reputation system can be
constructed for the Wikipedia that would facilitate the
detection of vandalism and provide quality cues for users.
