\section{Tracking Text Authorship}
\label{sec:diff-tracking}

To answer the question of which author contributed what text to a
collaborative document, we present first the general procedure to
perform the calculation.
We consider the problem, without loss of generality, for
a single article $\article{} \in \articles$,
with $n > 0$ revisions given by
\begin{equation*}
\versions{\article{}} = [ \version{1}, \version{2}, \ldots, \version{n} ].
\end{equation*}
We define the content of version \version{i}
as being a sequence of $l_i \ge 0$ words for all $0 < i \le n$,
given by:
\begin{equation}
\words{\version{i}} = [ w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_{l_i} ].
\label{def:words}
\end{equation}
For us, a \intro{word} is a whitespace-delimited sequence of
characters in the Wiki markup language that produces a Wikipedia article:
we work at the level of such markup language, rather than at the level
of the HTML produced by the wiki engine.
We also desire a function that gives the \intro{author} of a
revision; for a user $u \in \users$
that edited and committed article $a$ when version \version{i-1}
was the most recent, we define:
\begin{equation}
\revauthor{\version{i}} = u.
\label{def:revauthor}
\end{equation}
The MediaWiki software associates user $u$ to version \version{i} in
the database (or the IP address, in the case of anonymous users),
so that this information is readily available.




We conceive the problem of author attribution as a recursive relation:
the attribution of words in some version of the document depends on the
attribution of matching words from earlier versions.
At an abstract level, we can discover the inductive step by examining
the first several versions.
Clearly, for \version{1}, we have the author of the edit,
\revauthor{\version{1}}, as the author of each individual word.
To track the authorship of words in \version{2}, there are two cases:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A sequence of words in \version{2} also exists in \version{1}.
	In this case, we retain the original authorship of the words,
	\revauthor{\version{1}}.
\item A sequence of words in \version{2} does not also exist in \version{1}.
	In this case, the sequence must have been inserted by
	\revauthor{\version{2}}, and we assign authorship accordingly.
\end{enumerate}
Word authorship in \version{3} is similar to the situation in
\version{2}, with an additional case:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A sequence of words in \version{3} also exists in \version{2}.
	In this case, we retain the original authorship of the words
	that was determined for \version{2}.
\item A sequence of words in \version{3} does not also exist in \version{2},
	but does exist in \version{1}.
	Again, we retain the original authorship of the words, as it was
	determined for \version{1}.
\item A sequence of words in \version{3} does not exist in any previous
	revision.
	This sequence must have been inserted by \revauthor{\version{3}}.
\end{enumerate}

The general flavor of the computation is now clear, but to describe it
more precisely, we need some additional definitions.
For a given revision, we need to know the ordered list of revisions
earlier than \version{i}:
\begin{equation}
    \prevrevs{\version{i}} = \left[ \version{j} \colon  0 < j < i \right]
\label{def:prevrevs}
\end{equation}
And for some particular
word $w_r \in \words{\version{i}}$, we need to compute the
location of the best match from a list of earlier revisions:
\begin{equation}
    \match{\version{i}, r, \prevrevs{\version{i}}} =
    \begin{cases}
	(\version{k}, s) & \text{if there exists a best match $w_s \in \words{\version{k}}$.} \\
	\emptyset & \text{if there is no match.} \\
    \end{cases}
\label{def:bestmatch}
\end{equation}
where $\version{k} \in \prevrevs{\version{i}}$ since we are only
interested in matches with earlier revisions; we will better describe
this calculation in the next section.

Now it is possible to define the author of each word
$w_j \in \words{\version{i}}$ as a recursive relation:
\begin{equation}
\txtauthor{\version{i}, j} =
    \begin{cases}
	\txtauthor{\version{k}, s}, & \text{ if }
	\match{\version{i}, j, \prevrevs{\version{i}}} = (\version{k}, s) \\
	\revauthor{\version{i}}, & \text{ if there is no best match text. } \\
    \end{cases}
\label{def:txtauthor}
\end{equation}
