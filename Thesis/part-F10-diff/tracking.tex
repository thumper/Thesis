\section{Tracking Text Evolution}

We'd like to track the authorship of text in the face of revisions
by multiple authors.

Desirable properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item When text is deleted and then restored, we prefer the original author.
    This prevents edit wars or vandalism from disrupting the
    authorship of text.
\item When text is duplicated within an article, we prefer to assign
    authorship to the author of the original copy.
    This prevents a vandal from duplicating text and then deleting the
    original copy.
\item We don't want to over-reward the first author to use common
    words (\eg ``the,'' ``of'').
\item We prefer matches that are in the same relative order.
\item We prefer matches that were live more recently.
\item We prefer longer matches.
\end{enumerate}
