\section{Conclusions}

We propose two measures of revision quality computed
from Wikipedia's revision history, and evaluate them
using the PAN-WVC-10 annotated dataset.
Edit longevity performs much better than text longevity,
and we explain that the geometric decay model is not
a good choice for text which stabilizes.

OVerall, these results are encouraging for using edit
longevity and text longevity as signals for inferring
the community feedback of an author's edit.
Knowing the quality of edits, we can build an author
reputation system upon these signals; we describe such
a system in Chapter~\ref{ch:reputation}.
