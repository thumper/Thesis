\section{Conclusions}

We propose two measures of revision quality computed
from Wikipedia's revision history, and evaluate them
using the PAN-WVC-10 annotated dataset.
Edit longevity performs quite well, at over 91\% ROC-AUC;
very close to the performance of the winning solution from
the Wikipedia Vandalism Detection competition~\cite{Potthast2010b}.
The PR-AUC is more middling, near fourth place in the competition.
Text longevity is a much poorer predictor of vandalism.

Overall, this result is very encouraging because it means that one can
estimate the quality of revisions in a relatively simple way.
Knowing the quality of edits, we can build up a reputation
system for authors based on the quality of their work;
we describe such a system in Chapter~\ref{ch:reputation}.
