\section{Conclusion}

Evaluation of quality metrics is a real challenge.
What benchmark is appropriate for comparison?
Should a quality metric make a prediction about
the future of the revision it is measuring?
Or should it be aggregated by author and used
to predict the quality of future edits by the
same author?
We choose this latter strategy, by incorporating
both text longevity and edit longevity into a reputation
system which we evaluate by making predictions about the
future.
See Chapter~\ref{ch:reputation}.
