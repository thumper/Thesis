\section{Edit Quality}
\label{sec:editquality}

The problem with measuring text contribution quality alone is that it
measures only one kind of user behavior: inserting and deleting of text.
Another important behavior of users is to rearrange text
(possibly with minor edits) so that it improves the flow or
readability of the text.
In traditional publishing, this is the role that the editor
serves, as opposed to the the author --- and both are valuable
to the quality of the final product.
Is there any notion equivalent to text survival for edits?
In struggling to answer this question, we first had to measure
the size of an ``edit contribution,'' which naturally led us to the
\intro{edit distance}~\cite{Levenshtein66,TichyEditDist,EditDistanceMoves,Adler2007}
metric.

Edit distance is typically used as a way to measure how many
insertions, deletions, and replacements are needed to transform
one string into another, and is thus defined as the sum of the
number of those operations.
Other formulations exist for edit distance, and within the
context of the WikiTrust project we were already computing
text differences as part of our author tracking algorithms,
so we chose to define the distance between two revisions
in terms of the edit script generated by our greedy text
matching algorithm.
The elements making up an edit script are:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\mathbf{Move}(i_1, i_2, k)$ -- a matching block of text of
    length $k$, starting at position $i_1$ in the source string,
    and position $i_2$ in the target string.
\item $\mathbf{Delete}(i, k)$ -- the text starting at position $i$
    and extending for length $k$ was deleted from the source string.
\item $\mathbf{Insert}(i, k)$ -- the text starting at position $i$
    and extending for length $k$ was inserted into the target string.
\end{itemize}

  We would like to have a similar notion of survival for edits,
  particularly for the case where text is rearranged by an author
  different from the author who introduced the text.
  To accomplish this, we utilize the
  \intro{edit distance}~\cite{Levenshtein66,TichyEditDist,EditDistanceMoves,Adler2007}
  --- a measure of how many word insertions, deletions,
  and transpositions are needed to change one revision into the other ---
  to measure how different one version is from another.
  To turn this into a quality metric for the
  version \version{k}, we look at edits done as part of \revision{k}
  and ask ``does the work done bring us closer to how the page
  will look in the future?''
  If future versions incorporate and build on the changes of edit \revision{k},
  then the edits are of good quality.
  When future versions mostly undo or discard the work of \revision{k},
  then the edits are of bad quality.

	is made towards the future version of the article,

	during the edit.}

  To calculate the quality of an edit \revision{k},
  we additionally consider two \intro{reference versions}:
  the immediate past \version{k-1} and some future version \version{j}.
  These three points allow us to define a triangle
  (see the two examples in Figure~\ref{fig-editcontr})
  using the edit distances $d(\version{k-1},\version{k})$,
  $d(\version{k-1},\version{j})$ and $d(\version{k},\version{j})$.
  We then computes the ratio
  \begin{equation*}
  \editq(\version{k},\version{j}) = \bigl[ \dist(\version{k-1},\version{j})
  		- \dist(\version{k},\version{j}) \bigr]
	/ \dist(\version{k-1},\version{k})
  \end{equation*}
  between the ``useful work''
  $\dist(\version{k-1},\version{j}) - \dist(\version{k},\version{j})$ and the
  ``total work'' $\dist(\version{k-1},\version{k})$
  (see Figure~\ref{fig-editlong} for a pictorial representation).
  The ``total work'' $\dist(\version{k-1},\version{k})$
  is a measure of how much change
  was performed during the
  edit $\revision{k}: \version{k-1} \goesto \version{k}$;
  the ``useful work''
  $\dist(\version{k-1},\version{j}) - \dist(\version{k},\version{j})$
  is a measure of
  how much closer the article becomes to the future version \version{j}.
  For reverted edits, the ratio $\editq(\version{k},\version{j})$
  is $-1$, since all of the work
  goes into \textit{increasing} the distance between \version{k} and \version{j}.
  For edits that are preserved, $\editq(\version{k},\version{j})$ is close to~1.
  The \intro{edit longevity}, \elong, of edit \revision{k} is then taken to
  be the average edit quality as judged by the next three revisions:
  \begin{equation*}
      \elong(\revision{k}) = \sum_{i=k+1}^{\min(k+3, n)}
      		\editq(\version{k},\version{i})
  \end{equation*}
