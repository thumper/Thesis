\subsection{Sources of Error}

Since we use filtered revisions, namely we collapse all consecutive
revisions by the same author, and since we treat all anonymous authors
identically, consecutive edits made by anonymous authors cannot be
distinguished.
We therefore discard all anonymous authors from our analysis: in any
case, we are not measuring their contributions, as they cannot be
individually attributed. 
We have noticed that there are anonymous authors who do good work
on the Wikipedia, but at this point we have not implemented a
mechanism to attribute them a contribution measure.

We ignore the time difference between edits.
When pages receive many views with little editing, it suggests 
that the article is substantially correct;
perhaps later edits are due to changing facts, and not because 
of poor quality.
Articles which are the subject of current events are 
particularly likely to have their edit quality misjudged.
Relatedly, grouping revisions by author ignores the fact that 
edits separated by days or months are less related and have most 
likely been reviewed by others.
