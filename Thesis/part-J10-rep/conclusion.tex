\section{Conclusions}

In this chapter, we propose a reputation system for authors to allow us
to make an educated guess at the quality of a revision when it is first
made.
This reputation system is build atop notions developed as quality
measures in Chapter~\ref{ch:editquality}, and which themselves are
in turn built atop a difference algorithm defined in Chapter~\ref{ch:diff}.

To evaluate the effectiveness of our WikiTrust reputation system, we
test several different metrics and achieve results much better than
random chance.
We also compare favorably against a reputation based purely on the
number of edits made by authors (the so-called \intro{edit count}
reputation~\cite{Cross2006}), without the same exposure to simple
attacks.
