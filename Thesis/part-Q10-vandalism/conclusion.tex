\section{Conclusion}

\mynote{Need to come up with a conclusion.  Here are some notes.}

What is the point of vandalism detection?
To determine whether an edit needs further review.

Ultimately, Druck~\etal are right when they proclaim that
vandalism detection must look at the content of the
edit~\cite{Druck2008}.
Although metadata methods for identifying bad edits are
fairly capable, they can always be fooled by a sufficiently
motivated vandal.
Mola-Velasco demonstrates that language-based
models that are language independent can do quite
well~\cite{Mola2011}.
