\section{Experiment}

We ran the batch processing on the Enwiki-2010 dump file,
after modifying the code to print out reputation information
as the reputations are computed chronologically.

We collected features from the output of the batch process
for those revisions that are part of the PAN-2010 corpus.
We then run a machine learning algorithm over those features
to predict whether each revision is vandalism or not, as determined
in the PAN corpus.
