\section{Future Work}

Of course we could delve into more details about
the things described so far.  Or we could push forward
on new topics that might bear more fruit.

\subsection{Category Reputation}
\subsection{Edit Distance Graphs}

\subsection{Batch Jobs}

    Relation to user contributions.
    Can a Javascript interpreter be inserted into the processing?

\subsection{Revision Selection}

    Work of Martin Walker.
    Original idea to pick revision with highest average reputation.
    Idea to propagate reputation backwards, to give better reputation
    to old revisions.
    New idea is to pick revisions least likely to have vandalism.
