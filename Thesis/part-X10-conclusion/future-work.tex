\section{Future Work}

Of course we could delve into more details about
the things described so far.  Or we could push forward
on new topics that might bear more fruit.

\subsection{Category Reputation}

Just as some users prefer to edit the grammar of
articles instead of the content, we believe that
users will tend to focus their efforts on subject
areas where they have some expertise.
If true, it enables a refinement to the author
reputation system which tracks reputations in
each subject area.

\subsection{Batch Jobs}

    Relation to user contributions.
    Can a Javascript interpreter be inserted into the processing?

\subsection{Revision Selection}

    Work of Martin Walker.
    Original idea to pick revision with highest average reputation.
    Idea to propagate reputation backwards, to give better reputation
    to old revisions.
    New idea is to pick revisions least likely to have vandalism.

   In response to the fluid nature of Wikipedia content,
    some users would like to identify versions which
    are ``trustworthy;'' currently, the leading proposal
    for finding these \textit{stable revisions}
    involves manual voting by trusted editors.
    Our own text trust system can highlight text in
    an article which requires greater scrutiny, but
    still requires a diligent user to review previous
    revisions to understand how the article is evolving.
    We propose an automatic analysis of the article evolution
    to identify revisions which we believe
    have the highest overall trust.
