\section{Implementation}

\subsection{31-Jan-2011}

I started to reimplement the author contribution patches that
Vishwa had written, when I discovered/remembered that there's a
new way to do it in the current WikiTrust
code.\footnote{\url{http://www.wikiwtrust.net/write-your-own-analysis}}

This led me to creating my own analysis file,
\texttt{Fullcontribution\_analysis.ml}.
I have implemented the EditCount analysis, but am
still trying to learn how to run the code.
\begin{verbatim}
$ mkdir tmp
$ export OCAMLRUNPARAM=b
$ ./evalwiki -d tmp -eval_fullcontrib ../remote/analysis/dump-SantaCruzBeachBoardwalk.xml
\end{verbatim}
This gives an exception in \texttt{timeconv.ml}, so I need
to investigate what is happening.
Ah, it turns out that the time format generated by
\program{downloadwp2xml} was incorrect; I've fixed that
and now it works as I expect.
