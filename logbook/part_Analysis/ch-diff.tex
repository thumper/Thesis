\chapter{Diff Algorithm}

\section{Comparisons}

\subsection{17-Jan-2011}

I have this idea that I should show how the different
diff algorithms compare to each other.
I'm not sure it that's really practical, though, since
they primarily all select matches based on longest match
(which is our top priority, as well); so will there really be
any difference?

I wanted to download some text to experiment.
I created a text file \texttt{list.txt} with contents:
\begin{verbatim}
Abraham Lincoln     0
\end{verbatim}
And then ran
\begin{verbatim}
remote/analysis/downloadwp2xml < list.txt > dump-AL.xml
\end{verbatim}
