\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Feb-2010}

While speaking with Gary Wolf about Quantified Self materials,
we got to discussing wikipedia.
He told me a story about an article
(``The Battle of Genine'')
which he heard was being quietly manipulated by the Israelis.

\subsection{14-Apr-2010}

Erica has sent me a link to an article which has many edit
wars in it.
