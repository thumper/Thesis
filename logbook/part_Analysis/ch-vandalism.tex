\chapter{Vandalism Detection}

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{11-Apr-2010}

Both Ian and Luca have suggested that we enter the vandalism competition
part of the PAN~2010 LAB\footnote{\url{http://pan.webis.de}}.
While considering Ian's observation of the recent spike in
interest of our work, it occurred to me that the spike could
be because of this competition.

\section{Combining Signals}

\subsection{28-Sep-2010}

While in Poland for Wikimania, I spoke to several people about our
performance as a vandalism detection tool in the PAN~2010 competition.
Although there was some interest, most people referred me to (and were
excited about) the work of Andrew West presented at WikiSym a few days before.
Andrew's work uses a handful of signals (\eg some NLP, IP address, time of
day) and gets good results (he would have taken second place in
PAN~2010 if he had entered).
The most exciting thing about his work, however, is that he has a tool
(\program{STiki}) which is able to present his vandalism results to
the user so that they can inspect the edit and trigger a revert if
necessary --- and he collects the data about how his users ``voted''
on each edit.
This provides him with the opportunity to continue to build an
annotated corpus of edits\footnote{The problem with the current system
is that it only collects a single vote for each edit, so that the
annotations might not be very reliable.}, so that he can re-run the
machine learning algorithms.

With Luca's permission, I approached Andrew about a possible
collaboration where we try to combine the signals from our respective
solutions and see if we can get better performance.
Andrew hadn't entered PAN~2010 because his data didn't go back that
far, so we experimented on a corpus that Andrew had collected from 
his tool.
First, we discovered that the \function{ADTree} algorithm under
\package{Weka} out-performed Andrew's own \function{SVM}
implementation.
We also saw that \wikitrust seemed to perform a bit better than
\package{STiki}.
And finally, we saw a noticeable improvement when we combined our
signals using \function{ADTree}.

Andrew got really excited by these results, and generated the data
necessary for the PAN~2010 corpus.
On this corpus, our combined signals was able to score an AUC of 95-97\%!

While working on this task, I was stymied by some \wikitrust bugs:
our update process skips some revisions, and our page titles are not
easy to search.
I decided that the time had come to fix these bugs, so I have been
working on a new branch to implement these changes.
