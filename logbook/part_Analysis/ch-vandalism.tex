\chapter{Vandalism Detection}

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{11-Apr-2010}

Both Ian and Luca have suggested that we enter the vandalism competition
part of the PAN 2010 LAB\footnote{\url{http://pan.webis.de}}.
While considering Ian's observation of the recent spike in
interest of our work, it occurred to me that the spike could
be because of this competition.
