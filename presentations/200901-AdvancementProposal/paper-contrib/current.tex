\subsection{Summary of Completed Research}

We start with some definitions.
There are two basic ``quantity'' measures that
form the basis of our contribution measures:
$\txt(r)$ is the amount of text added in
revision $r$ of an article, and $\dist(r)$
is the edit distance of revision $r$ from
the revision previous to it.
There are also three basic ``quality'' measures
that we are able to define based on our previous
reputation research:
$\tlong(r)$ is a measure of the text longevity
of text added in revision $r$,
$\elong(r)$ is a measure of the edit longevity
of changes made for revision $r$,
and $\tenrevsq(r)$ simply is the sum of the amount
of text added in revision $r$ which is left over
in each of the ten revisions after $r$ divided by
the amount of text originally added.
We define $\editset(a)$ as the set of revisions
made by author $a$ across all pages.
This allows us to define the several contribution measures
presented in Table~\ref{tab-measures}.


\begin{table*}[!tp]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|rl|l|}
	\hline
\numedits(a) &$= \sum_{r\in\editset(a)} 1 \cdot 1 $&
	\text{Counts the number of edits made by the author.} \\
\textonly(a) &$= \sum_{r\in\editset(a)} 1 \cdot \txt(r)  $&
	\text{Counts the number of words added.} \\
\editonly(a) &$= \sum_{r\in\editset(a)} 1 \cdot \dist(r) $&
	\text{Sums the size of the edits made.} \\
\textlong(a) &$= \sum_{r\in\editset(a)} \tlong(r) \cdot \txt(r) $&
	\text{Sums the number of words added, factoring in quality.}\\
\editlong(a) &$= \sum_{r\in\editset(a)} \elong(r) \cdot \dist(r) $&
	\text{Sums the size of edits made, factoring in quality.}\\
\tenrevs(a)  &$= \sum_{r\in\editset(a)} \tenrevsq(r) \cdot \txt(r) $&
	\text{Sums the amount of text left over the next ten revisions.}\\

\caption[Contributions measures]{
This table presents the contribution measures we considered,
written so that each measure is clearly multiplying
``quality'' by ``quantity.''
