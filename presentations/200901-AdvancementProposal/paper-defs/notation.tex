The following notation will be used throughout the paper.
We assume that we have $n > 0$ versions $v_0, v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ of a
document; version $v_0$ is empty, and version $v_i$,
for $1 \leq i \leq n$, is obtained by author \editor{i} performing an
edit $\revision{i}: \version{i-1} \goesto \version{i}$.
We refer to the change set corresponding to
$\revision{i}: \version{i-1} \goesto \version{i}$
as the {\em edit\/} performed at $\revision{i}$: the edit consists of the text
insertions, deletions, displacements, and replacements that led from
$\version{i-1}$ to $\version{i}$.

When editing versioned documents, authors commonly save several
versions in a short time frame, in order to avoid losing their work
due to computer or network problems.
To ensure that such behavior does not affect reputations, we
\textit{filter} the versions, keeping only the \textit{last} of consecutive
versions by the same author; we assume therefore that
$\editor{i} \neq \editor{i+1}$,
where $1 \leq i < n$.

Every version $\version{i}$, for $0 \leq i \leq n$, consists of a sequence
$[w^i_1, \ldots, w^i_{m_i}]$ of words, where $m_i$ is the number of
words of $v_i$; we have $m_0 = 0$.
For us, a {\em word\/} is a whitespace-delimited sequence of
characters in the Wiki markup language that produces a Wikipedia article:
we work at the level of such markup language, rather than at the level
of the HTML produced by the wiki engine.
