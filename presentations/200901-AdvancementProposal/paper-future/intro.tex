To date, we have built a framework of tools for examining
the Wikipedia edit history.
Using this framework, we have created prototype implementations
of content-driven author reputation and text trust;
our evaluation of these systems is very encouraging.
We plan to leverage the completed work to continue
our investigation into author reputation and its applications.
Trust coloring of text~\cite{WikiMTWtrust06,Cr06,McGuinness06,WikiTrust2008}
is one such application of a reputation system,
but there are several others; a common example is to
\textit{sandbox} articles edited by low trust users,
until a higher reputation user can review the work.
