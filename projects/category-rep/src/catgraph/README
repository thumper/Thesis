Need the categorylinks file:
    http://download.wikimedia.org/enwiki/20080312/enwiki-20080312-categorylinks.sql.gz
and the pageinfo file:
    http://download.wikimedia.org/enwiki/20080312/enwiki-20080312-page.sql.gz   


To build the category graph data:
	./buildCategoryGraph.pl categorylinks.sql.gz page.sql.gz
The resulting data must go into a directory specified in showcatstats.ml.

=====================================================

traceCategoryChildren.pl tells you how many subcategories there are for a category,
and how many pages, and recursively follows the categories for 2 levels.
       ./traceCategoryChildren.pl History

=====================================================

Similarly, traceCategoryChildren goes 10 levels up the category
heirarchy to tell you what the parent categories are.
Along the way, it identifies topics that appear to be
major headings, by checking for their inclusion in
the category "Main_topic_classifications".
      ./traceCategoryChilren.pl Teen_dramas

====================================================

This program is used to find out the "Main_topic_classifications"
categories for every page in the system.  It creates two output
files:
 * cat2rootcat.txt - gives the set of root categories for every category.
   A category is a root if it is an immediate child of Main_topic_classifications.
   When more than one category is a root, it is because there were equidistant
   paths from the root to this category.
 * page2rootcat.txt - gives the set of root categories for every page.
   In this case, we assume that every category assigned to the page is
   relevant, so we coalesce all the root categories of each category
   (irrespective of how far the paths might be to the root).
      ./buildPageCategories.pl

=====================================================

To double-check the output from buildPageCategories.pl,
I wrote programs to translate the resulting text files back to text:
      ./translateCat2Rootcat.pl
      ./translatePage2Rootcat.pl

=====================================================

To measure the amount of mutual information between categories,
I wrote another program
      ./measureCovariance.pl page2rootcat.txt > covar.txt
      sort -n -k 3 covar.txt | less
