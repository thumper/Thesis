compareDiff.pl - used to compare BasicDiff and FasterDiff to make
	sure that the edit scripts returned match up.

compareTracking.pl - compares the results of BasicTextTracking
     and FasterTextTracking to make sure the results match up

computeSurvival.pl - reads in a dump, and computes the authorship
    of each word for every filtered revision.  For every revision,
    outputs the number of words "owned" by it or earlier revs.

	computeSurvival.pl dump-Something.xml > track-Something.txt
	graphSurvival.pl track-Something.txt

graphSurvival.pl - reads in the output from computeSurvival.pl
    and picks out interesting graphs to display in gnuplot


computeDistances.pl - does diffs between nearby revisions, and
    computes the edit distance between them.  Generates output
    suitable for 'neato' (part of the DOTVIZ package)
