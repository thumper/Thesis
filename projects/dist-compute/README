Configure the list of hosts and working directories
Example dist.cfg:
===
thumper@bsi-la.fastcoder.net	/mnt/archive3/WikiTrust/util/distribute/tmp
thumper17@redherring.cse.ucsc.edu       /big/thumper/tmp
===

1. Build distribution on new servers
    ./build_server.pl dist.cfg


use the Makefile to build ocaml and all the libraries
needed by WikiTrust.  Edit Makefile to give the path
for where you want godi installed.

Use dist_stat.pl to distribute the statistics computation across
multiple hosts.  In file "dist.cfg" put in lines "<ssh-host>\t<dir>".
The same host/dir pair can appear multiple times to have multiple
evals running in parallel on the host.
Then run as
  ./dist_stats.pl --splits output-enwiki/split_wiki --stats output-enwiki/stats dist.cfg
On each host, run "make dist_prep" to get the dir ready.

If you are using EC2, then dist_mkcfg.pl will take the output from
ec2-describe-instances, and generate the lines to add to dist.cfg

=====

	export OUTPUT=/mnt/thumper/tmp-rep-enwiki/output
	./dist-stats.pl --splits $OUTPUT/split_wiki --stats $OUTPUT/stats dist.cfg
