This directory contains code to evaluate
text and edit longevity using the PAN2010
corpus as a golden annotation for "bad edits".


1. Extract the PAN2010 revids from PAN-WVC-10

	export PANDIR=/big/thumper/pan2010/newpan2010/pan-wikipedia-vandalism-corpus-2010
	./extract-PAN2010-revids.pl $PANDIR/edits.csv $PANDIR/gold-annotations.csv > pan2010.csv

2. Extract "useful" revisions from Wikipedia dump:

	./extract-revidsFdump.pl pan2010.csv /giant/enwiki-20100130/split_wiki/ > /big/thumper/pan2010dump.xml

3. Count how many PAN2010 revisions we actually found:

	./count-matchingRevids.pl pan2010.csv /raid/thumper/pan2010dump.xml

(4) This step is no longer valid.
   Compute the text and edit longevity measures for all the
   revisions in the dump.

	./compute-LongevityFeatures.pl /big/thumper/pan2010dump.xml > pan2010longevity.csv

   This step seems to take a very long time: about 30sec for text tracking
   and 5min for edit distances, for each revision.  Given how long this
   takes, and the divergence from how the calculation is done in OCaml,

   I don't use this program any longer, and instead use the thumper-vandalrep
   version of WikiTrust.  See next step.

4. Run the various tests for diff algo, match quality, etc.
	time ./run-expt.sh > expt.out 2>&1

5. Compute the latex tables from the output
	./parse-exptResults.pl expt.out
    output will be in expt.out-table-textlong.tex and expt.out-table-editlong.tex
