This directory contains code to evaluate
text and edit longevity using the PAN2010
corpus as a golden annotation for "bad edits".


1. Extract the PAN2010 revids from PAN-WVC-10

	export PANDIR=/big/thumper/pan2010/newpan2010/pan-wikipedia-vandalism-corpus-2010
	./extract-PAN2010-revids.pl $PANDIR/edits.csv $PANDIR/gold-annotations.csv > pan2010.csv

2. Extract "useful" revisions from Wikipedia dump:

	./extract-revidsFdump.pl pan2010.csv /giant/enwiki-20100130/split_wiki/ > /big/thumper/pan2010dump.xml

3. Count how many PAN2010 revisions we actually found:

	./count-matchingRevids.pl pan2010.csv /big/thumper/pan2010dump.xml

4. Compute the text and edit longevity measures for all the
   revisions in the dump.

	./compute-LongevityFeatures.pl /big/thumper/pan2010dump.xml > pan2010longevity.csv

   This step seems to take a very long time: about 30sec for text tracking
   and 5min for edit distances, for each revision.
