split-chunks2articles.pl
   - convert splitwiki output into a series of files, one per article,
	containing revisions.  This didn't work out because the splitwiki
	data I found had XML errors in it.

merge-revtree.pl
   - takes a tree of revisions (one file per revision),
	and appends data to the compressed "one per article"
	files.  Only useful to correct my mistake of "one file
	per revision."

sort-articles.pl
   - sort the revisions in each "one file per article"

split-dump2articles.pl
   - convert dump output into a series of files, one per article, containing revisions.

merge-arttree.pl
    - takes two trees of articles and merges them.
      Note that the two trees have different input formats.

merge-dump2articles.pl
   - like split-dump2articles.pl, but will also merge in the additionally downloaded
	data from Sept 2009.

============================

** These files are the final ones used:

selected-titles.pl
    - grab the list of titles being included in Wikipedia 0.7.

download-by-title.pl
    - given a list of titles on STDIN, downloads them in parallel.
	Uses several *.db files to track information about the
	articles downloaded.  (Used "sort-articles.pl" to initially
	create these *.db files for the data I had already downloaded.)
	Output is a list of page ids that are done being downloaded
	(and thus need to be sorted in chronological order).

sort-one-article.pl
    - reads list of page ids from STDIN, and sorts each file to
	a temporary file (same disk), which is swapped in when complete.

reset-one-article.pl
    - earlier versions of download-by-title.pl would leave partial XML records
	in the article files, breaking the XML parsing in sort-one-article.pl.
	This program removes the article file and resets the last revid for the
	page to be 0 so that the entire article is downloaded.
	This isn't necessary any longer since download-by-title.pl now
	checks for errors before outputing a record.
