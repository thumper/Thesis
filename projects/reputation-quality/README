This directory contains code to evaluate
reputation using the PAN2010
corpus as a golden annotation for "bad edits".

1. Follow the initial steps from "../edit-quality/README"

2. Extract the reputation scores for the PAN revisions.

    ./extract-repsFrepfile.pl pan2010.csv \
	/raid/thumper/util/tmp/output-enwiki/user_reputations.txt
	> features-reputation.csv

3. Extract other features from SQL files:
    ./extract-dataFsql.pl pan2010.csv \
	/raid/thumper/util/tmp/output-enwiki/sql \
	> features-sqlbased.csv

    (Note that these steps are separate because they take so long
    to run.  Having them separate allows us to rerun any single step.)
