The programs in this directory are used to
process the "stats" files from the batch process
to compute some aggregate values.

calc-revertspeed.pl - takes a "stats" dir as the argument,
and reads through all the stats looking for cases that
look like reverts.  It adds up the time from the vandalism
to the revert, and then averages.  For the 2010 enwiki stats,
I computed 185K seconds as the mean time to revert.
over 1.4 million reverts.
